# Saliency maps for Neural Population Decoders (NPD)
Project for classifying biological neurons according to some stimulus data.
For example. 
Recording neural activity from a mouse while it watches different images. Create an NPD which classifies image from neural activity.
Use saliency maps to credit different neurons' firing pattern for making the prediction. This implies that the neuron is important for said classification
and has a preference towards certain image classes. Hence we can label these neurons according to the type of input.
